    <h1> Web Hosting </h1>
<body>
   <h2><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/"target="_blank">Blue Host</a></h2> 
    </body>
    <p>Blue host offers the website hosting plans out of all of the websites I have visited. 
        
        <ol>-Their four plans range in price from 2.95$ and month to $13.95 a month</ol>
        <ol>-Their pro plan is 13.95 with the promotion they are currently running. It is usually 28.99$ a month which is a little more expensive compared to other host website plans I have looked at. </ol>
        <ol>-Although they do offer the first year of your domain for free. </ol>

    
    <p>Their online experts will design your website for you and listen to any feedback you have about its appearance. They are able to listen to people's Ideas and set their website up for success. Their plans cover websites with backup security even though they are prepared for becoming high traffic websites. </p>

<p>The reason I believe that blue host is the best hosting platform is because of their reliability. They are highly rated and have easy to use tools. They also have customer support 24/7 that would be able to answer any questions or fix any problems my website may be experiencing. It is comforting to know that they take good care of their customers, which is worth the expensive cost to me.

    <h3><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/"target="_blank">Host Gator</a></h3>
   
        
    <ol>1. Cost Host gator has three different hosting plans, with each of these plans they will throw in a free domain for a year.  </ol>
    
    <ol>2. Currently they are running a promotion so each of their plans are over 50% off. </ol>
    
    <ol>3. The cost is concerning to me because I can't figure out how much a plan would be without the promotions they are running. </ol>
       
        
    <p> As of right now Host gator is screaming deal. It is super cheap and each of their three plans include, </p>
    <ol>1. Chat support</ol>
    <ol>2. Unmetered bandwidth</ol> 
    <ol>3. Basic email included</ol> 
    <ol>4. Free domain 1st Year</ol>
    <ol>5. Free SSL</ol>
    <ol>6. WordPress pre-installed</ol> 
    <ol>7. Malware Scanning</ol>
    
    <p>Through each plan the more you pay the more GB SSD Storage you would have, along with Increased performance through vCPU's and Daily Website Backups. </p>
        
        
        <p>Becuase of everything that Host gator offers, with free domain, cheep hosting plans and a website that is neat, organized and easy to navigate they are my number two choice.</p>

    <p>Fat cow gets point for having a creative name. In all seriousness I picked fat cow for a few reasons.</p>
        <ol>-The first being that they have 24/7 coustomer support. This is something I love because with building websites it can be frustrating and it is nice to have someone constantly there to solve problems.</ol> 
    
    <ol>-With fat cow you get CND included, custom word press themes (which will help your website stick out).</ol> 
    <ol>-A free SSL and a free domain which seems very popular with all the hosting sites.</ol>  
    <ol>Their intro price is currently 2.95$ a month which allows you to test out your website and decide if you would like to stick with this hosting program.</ol> 
    
    <ol>Fat cow is also related to <u>blue host</u>which is my number one hosting service. You can go through them to get to the four plans that <u>blue host</u> offers. However the reason that Fat cow is at the bottom of my list is because you have to get through them to go to <u>blue host</u>, which is just complicating the process.</ol>
