          <h2> The Seasons!</h2>

            <p>The four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, are different ends of a natural cycle of change that bring variation and beauty to our environment. Each season has its own attributes and characteristics as we run through it each year. Spring wakes nature from its winter slumber-a promise that new life in one form or another will soon be blooming. The trees display budding leaves and blooming flowers; warm temperatures call people out of their houses, while longer days herald a time for rebuilding and restoration. Spring signals the beginning of new life and has become synonymous with seed-plants or pre-summer preparations.</p>

            <p>Spring is followed by summer, which brings along heat, sun, and freedom. Summer is filled with vacations, beachside trips, and offers plenty of outdoor activities where the long days stretch into evenings. Other people adore summer for its sunshine and abundance, and the ripening fruits and blooming flowers. For summer usually means "no more classes," the association between summer and relaxation is even deeper when viewed through the eyes of children. And with energy and an increase in the hours of sunlight come activities: games, fairs, and picnics.</p>

            <p>With shorter days, lower temperatures, and a natural quieting, autumn and winter usher in the close of the cycle. Autumn sees nature change colors-trees shed leaves, animals gather supplies, preparing for the sandy landscapes of winter. Winter is the final season in the cycle, buried beneath frozen soil and cloaked in snow in some parts of the world, with most of the plant life asleep. Many times, people set up warm zones in their homes, holding holidays and quietly reflecting on happenings of the past year. While winter allows for earth to pause and renew, providing a quiet closure before spring once again arrives to commence the cycle. </p>
