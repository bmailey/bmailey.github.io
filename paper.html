    <p>I love Amazon's website. This site is different from other sites because of the amount of products that it sells. It has many name-brand products along with dupes. It also has multiple sales going on every day. The way the products are shown isn't overwhelming. Each product has pictures or videos. There are reviews for each product and you have the availability to review products you have bought to get money back. Also, any product ordered off this website is very simple to return. All you need is a barcode they provide for you, you don't even need a box!</p>	
   
    
    
    <p>The code for the Amazon tab that I am on seems very complicated. There are multiple different boxes with code displayed on them. It seems very modern and yes they are using HTML5 elements. I see these elements in the very top box. The box has DOCTYPE HTML at the top, the same as the websites we have been making. It is then followed by head and body class. There are a lot of Classes and IDs that pop up in this HTML code. </p>
   
    
    
    <p>The layout does not make a lot of sense to me. I believe this is because there is so much of it that it is frustrating to sort through it. You can scroll through the code and then another table pops up with more code inserted into it. It isn't hard to navigate, it is just hard for me to understand all that is happening in the code. On the other hand, the website is extremely easy to navigate. You can look up any item and they will have it or other recommendations for you. The major colors this site uses it white, black, red, navy, and orange. They use the color effectively by having the colors contrast themselves so they are easy to see and pick up on the screen. Like the video, we watched in class about color. Your eyes will always find the anchor point of color.  </p> 
   
    
    
    <p>For the little things, the site uses pictures in small boxes with white borders and black lettering to help you read and see what the product it,for reviews, there are orange stars that are easy to see that are filled in from 1-5 stars depending on people's reviews. easy returns are given through QR and bar codes. Delivery messages are at the top of your order in green or red to say “good to go” or “stop not working” to keep their customer happy. They even have an AI on the site now named Rufus that can help you find what you are looking for and answer questions you have. I haven't seen another shopping website provide you with an AI yet. </p>

    <p> The next website I reviewed was Crumbl Cookie’s website. I dislike this website. The thing that sets this website apart from others as it loads there is a video at the top with a video of cookies. This is very chaotic and takes up almost half of the page, the other half is just blank white. Once yo scroll down you see a flying cookie. This is where you can see the weekly flavors. The frustrating part of this is you can only view one flavor at a time so it takes awhile scrolling though to see what the options are. </p>

    
    
    <p>The next problem is that they don't have the same cookies at every restaurant. So those cookies might not even be the options that your location has to offer. So you have to input you location and find your store before you can see what your options for cookies are. Overall it is very hard to navigate, it is not well done and it would be fast just to call the store to figure out what the flavors are.</p>
    
    
    
    
	<p>Looking at this site code it is very clean and repetitive. There are many sections of “script-src” which is when they are talking about their weekly flavors. This code is extremely organized and simple. The hard part of the code is in the header where the video is uploaded. Also under the console, there are a few red exclamation points. These all read “error 425” which i looked up and it says that it is a framework error. 
	The layout does make sense to me. It reminds me of when we made the grid of images but if we would make the order lists then just the sides of the website that we were putting them on. The website is frustrating to navigate but the code is not that hard to navigate. As for the colors, it is also a little frustrating. The main colors of Crumbl is pink and white. So they have those on the website but then they clash with the colors of the cookies. They do have a white background that makes it easier to read about the cookies because their description is in black text. They also have many borders put into the code so that the descriptions and pictures of the cookies are next to each other.     
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>The last website I reviewed was Shein. This website I do like but not because of the way it is designed. When opening the website there is always a sale coupon on the top border of the website. There is usually popup ads, and a sale wheel you have to spin to get it out of your view. The code is extremely clean and modern they are using HTML5 and DOCTYPE. There is even a box in the code that shows you the margin, border, and padding. When scrolling on this box it highlights what segments are in each area. That is something that sets this sites code apart from others that I have looked at. 

        
        
    <p>The layout of this website does make sense to me. It is like many websites with the search bar right at the top. The code it different from other websites because it has many many pages to it. These pages are assailable from tabs that are labeled like “styles, computed, layout, DOM breakouts, Properties” and about 100 more tabs. Each of these tables has many tables under them. </p>
    
    
    
     <p>You can navigate around it well, I see the 2 col in this website. There is a scrolling effect to it but there are also multiple tabs once you are done scrolling. They don't really have a set color, THe background it white and the text is black on items. Those are the most prominent colors and then their sales are marked out in red. </p>

    
    
    <p>The thing that the site does that sets it apart is the complete chaos in colors it has going on in the margin and border. They have many sale codes at the top and bottom that are all in yellow, orange, and blue. They get your attention because they are so out of place. Thier products also don't have a large gap between each other so they clash in color. </p>
