             <h1>In this Assignment I will be ranking the five following state websites.</h1>
             
             <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">1. Arkansas</a>
             
             <p><u> Arkansas Is my number one ranked website.</u> </p>
                <ul> - fore color and design, when entering the website The colors are blue and white. It may just be a personal preference but these colors are calming to my eyes. They don't make the website page overwhelming when it first opens. I also enjoyed how there are pictures that are shifting throughout the website. They are on about a 10 second timer, which is not a lot of time to read what is on the pictures. But each picture has a navigation box that allows you to read more about what each one is representing.</ul>
             
             <ul>
                - The website loads quickly, I do think that with the pictures included on the website they change too quickly if you are trying to read what one of them says right off the bat. When clicking links around the website each one opened quickly. I did not run into any "Error page not found" problems, which is a professional website so I didn't expect to but you never know. 
                 </ul>
             <ul>
                 - The menu is easy to see and extremely easy to navigate, especially compared to the websites. They have a search bar right at the top of the page so you don't have to search around to look for one. They also have a pop up box that allows you to chat instantly with an AI response to answer any questions you have. 
             </ul>
             
             <ul>
                 - Lastly This website looks really nice when shrunk down to iphone size. Which means that it is compatible with different screen sizes. 
             
             </ul>
             
              <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">2. Maine </a>
             
             <p><u>Maine is my second ranked website.</u></p>
             <ul>-When you open up Maine's state website the colors are lost of different types of blues with white borders. The design of the website included a beautiful picture of their state capital along with other animated pictures that have links attached to them to find more information about them. Mains website is well designed and is not overstimulating with different colors. It is my second on website ranking because even though the design is cute, it is not on that same level as Arkansas </ul>
             
             <ul> - Maines website loads fast and when scrolling through the website it doesn't have any annoying pop ups and you are able to get to the bottom of the main page quickly. When Shrinking the screen to iphone size it also works well. Some of the information moves on the page so it appears differently on the page. If you were used to looking at the website from a computer it could get confusing on where things went. </ul>
             
             <ul> - The menu is easy to use both on my computer and on my Iphone. It looks like a hamburger menu, on my computer it only takes up a third of the screen so I am able to look at the page and the menu at the same time. On my phone it is kind of annoying because it takes over 75% of the screen. They do have a search bar right at the top of the page which is easy to find and easy to look things up with. </ul>
             
             <ul> - It is easy to find things on mains website because of their menu, search bar that is easy to locate. They also have trending searches which are what many people are probably visiting the website for.  
             </ul>
             
             <p><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">3. Kansas</a></p>
            <p> <u>Kansas Is my number third ranked website.</u></p>
             <ul>- Kansas design isn't my favorite, but it wasn't the worst. The colors include yellow, blue and red. The lettering is in white and blue depending on the background. They could do better on making their website look less blocky. It seems very bland and nothing pops out to you that is visually interesting.
             </ul>
             
             <ul>- Kansas website loads fast but when I went into the chat box it wasn't working. I was connected to wifi and it told me I couldnt use it because I did not have any wifi connection. Which is just frustrating not to be able to properly use the website. 
             </ul>
             
             <ul> - Kansas the menu is directly in the middle of the screen which I thought was very weird. This appears as a very small menu and doesn't give many options that you can re-route to. It shows up this way both on my phone and on my laptop which I am not fond of. It doesn't take up much room on my phone screen but it doesnt give me many options to choose from.</ul>
             
             
             
              <p><a href="https://alaska.gov/">`4. Alaska</a></p>
             
            <p><u> The website of the state of Alaska is my fourth ranked website</u></p>
             <ul>- Alaska's website colors I do enjoy, they are white and blue hues. Their letting stands out in white but it gets confusing when it is in blue because it makes an entire paragraph look like one you can click on. Next for the design I do not enjoy how their main picture is cut into three panels. Also their links and information are in very tiny fonts which can make it hard to read. I feel like Alaska is such a beautiful state with many activities, wildlife and outdoor sceneries and they did not show this off whatsoever.  
             </ul>
             
             <ul>-The alaska website loads fast but the amount of links on the first page is almost overwhelming. I would not want to read through twenty plus links to find the one that is corresponding to what I want to read about. The menu and search bar is what makes up for this because they are both easy to access and is what I would be using to navigate through this website.
             
             
             </ul>
             
             <ul>- This website was not made to view from a touchscreen device with a tiny screen. This is because just scrolling through it I would accidently hit a link with my finger and have to hit the back button to where it would reroute me back to the top of the main page. This is extremely frustrating. 
             </ul>
      
             
              <p><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">`5. Maryland</a></p>
             <p><u>The website of the state of Maryland is my Fifth ranked website</u></p>
             
             <ul>- Maryland is the last ranked state out of my five states. The website's colors are hues of red. This is hard to read through and look at because it appears like everything is meshed together to me. It is cool that they have a moving video in the background but if i'm trying to focus on reading on the main page it is frustrating because there is movement all over the screen. It also made me a little motion sick just looking at it.      
             
             </ul>
             
             <ul>- The website loads fast but there isn't much information to click on through the main page. The menu on the page takes up way too much room and is a solid black which does not meet the theme they are chasing with the red. It also sticks out too far on the page which covers up information. 
             </ul>
             
             <ul>When moved to my phone screen the website becomes overwhelming. The pictures on the website are too big for the screen. You are not able to read what it says under the picture without having half of the picture out of the frame. This is something I hated because I couldn't look fully at what it was. The menu was extremely frustrating because it almost covered my entire page.       
             
             </ul>
             
             </body>
