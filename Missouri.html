           <p>If you would like to go fly fishing in Montana I suggest going on the Missouri River. Located about 30 minutes away from Helena. The Missouri River runs right through Craig Montana, making it the fly fishing capital of the world. You are able to catch Brown, Rainbow, and even white fish on the Missouri River. The river also has beautiful views of the great outdoors of Montana. There's a high chance you will get to see wildlife such as bevers, bald eagles, pheasants, deer, muskrats, and much more. Located in Craig are a few fly shops where you can pick up flies and suggestions from other fishermen about where you should fish on the river. Once you are done fishing you can also grab a bite to eat at the restaurant in Craig!
