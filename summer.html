          <h2>"Deep summer is when laziness finds respectability"</h2>
        <p> My personal favorite, summer. Summer  is perfect for outdoor activities. With the warm weather and school being out it is perfect for adventure. For example, hiking, swimming, boating, fishing tanning and much more.  </p>
            
        <p> Summer last three months June, July and August. July and August are when the weather actually start to get warmer. The fourth of july is Independence Day in the United states. I ussaly spend this day around a lake with my family. We will go boating, ride jet skis and have a BBQ. We then end the night with a firework show. </p>
